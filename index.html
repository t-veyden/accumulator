        <h2>But wait a minute. You're 25, where were you before?</h2>
        <p>Well, first of all i spent 5 years on "studying" public service or however that's called. Then they changed everything and now i'm neither master nor bachelor, cool. Here's my specialisation:</p>
        <p>РАНХиГС bla bla</p>
        <p>Somewhere at that time i enrolled in local theatre studio in Volgograd. I studied and played there for almost two years. I have no proof but some blurred photographs, but then again - who would lie about such a thing?</p>
        <p>At the same time i started to help people out with graphic design. I told everyone i want to be an illustrator, but they mixed it all up as usual. Here's some of my work:</p>
        <p>I never said i didn't do illustration as well:</p>
        <p>In winter 2016 i went to Moscow to participate in creative internship as event manager / performer (such a thing exists) in main Cardboardia Embassy and its Made in Cardboardia worshop. 2 weeks went by and i ended up working with these wonderful people for almost a year. I did graphic design (ugh), copywriting, basic smm, internship management, and lots of 2-language writing and translation. Theater skills came in handy too, since from time to time i worked as a performer as well. Check it out here:</p>
